    "Description": "So this is my second cover of Final Countdown. The first one, which is still on my channel, was playable live with just two hands and nothing else was layered. This one includes all the parts found in the original recording which were layered in at the studio and would require an additional keyboard player to do live, so I layered them into this video. Please comment your thoughts or questions and please click \"like\" if you like it!\n\nOn the first video, some of the \"layered\" parts from the original recording could still be heard because the RipXDaw software I used to remove the parts only did so much and some of those parts still bled through. On this video, I used Moises to remove the keyboard parts and it did a much better job at pulling the original keyboard parts out. For the added layered parts, I programmed and played all of those sounds and layered them in. Those parts including the synth-bass, the riser effect when it transitions from the pad to the pipe organ, and the high-octave string on the final chords during the big intro sequence. The background brass part at the end of the final \"solo\" part after the guitar solo and I left the little riser (this was just my own thing) at the end of that part as well. I updated many of the individual programs including the main brass riff a bit too. I re-did the opening sound effects to match the original as close as I could. I also lowered the overall volume on the lead brass sound to better match the original which was more complimentary, and not overpowering the vocals. Some uplighting to match the colors on the album cover too. :)\n\nFinal Countdown was one of the most iconic 80's songs, with that most recognizable big brass sound everyone knows. I've seen the band live but they dub that opening part in up until the drums start... wish they played it live! \n\nKeyboards used:\nKorg Kronos 3, Nord Stage 4, Yamaha MODX M7, Oberheim OB-X8.\n\nThe original song is the copyrighted property of the original owner. Just doing this for fun. There is no profit or monetization being gained from this.",
